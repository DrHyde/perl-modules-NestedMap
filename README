This module allows you to more easily use map{}s within map{}s by making
inner maps' idea of what $_ is visible to outer maps by way of a stack.

To install, do the usual:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

You may use, modify and distribute this code under the same terms as you
may use, modify and distribute perl itself.
